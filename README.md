## About

## Notes to build your first expo app

To create a new app open a new terminal and enter the follow:

```terminal
npx create-expo-app my-first-app
```

then cd into the directory

```terminal
cd my-first-app
```

In order to run the app on the web, dependencies must be installed by running the following commands:

```terminal
npx expo install react-dom react-native-web @expo/webpack-config
```
